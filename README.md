## Overview
A Companionâ€™s existence gives us a reason to express ourselves, go on adventures, and learn who we are. Companions are similar to Assistants like Siri and Alexa, but with more emphasis on personal growth and development.

This repo contains an ever evolving list of prompts to help encourage a person to think and self reflect. Feel free to add more.
